WARNING:

You should not store anything in MobaXterm HOME directoy (/home/mobaxterm): with your current settings, this folder is not "persistent", so it will be cleared at each MobaXterm restart.

If you want to set a "persistent" HOME directory which will not be cleared at each MobaXterm startup, go to MobaXterm settings window and choose a folder in which to store MobaXterm home files.
